## RESNET-50
	
  ResNet is a short name for Residual Network. The principle on which ResNets work is to build a deeper networks compared to other 
plain networks and simultaneously find a optimised number of layers to negate the vanishing gradient problem. It is a very popular and 
powerful model.

## What Does ResNet Do?
	
  The main goal of the residual network is to build a deeper neural network. We can have two intuitions based on this:
		*As we keep going deeper into implementing large amount of layers, one should make sure not to degrade the accuracy and 
error rate. This can be handled by identity mapping.
		*Keep learning the residuals to match the predicted with the actual
	
## Observation
	
  *The dataset consists of 9 different set of sports with 2745 images.
  
  *From the proposed approach we were able to get accuracy of 94.7%

## Extend Project
	
  *Add more classes(extending dataset )
  
  *Do live video classification 
  
  *Recognising players
